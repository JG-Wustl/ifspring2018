Midway through the season, Aang gathers friends he met in previous episodes and leads a failed invasion into the Fire Nation. Former antagonist and anti-hero Zuko changes sides and joins Aang, serving as his Firebending teacher until the four-part series finale when Aang finally defeats the Fire Lord and ends the one hundred-year war in a surprising way: he uses a new ability to take away Ozai's firebending abilities to avoid violating selfless Air Nomad teachings.</p>

				<p>The season is then followed by The Promise, The Search, and The Rift comic series that take place one or two years later after the hundred-year war's end.</p>
