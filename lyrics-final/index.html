						Drake has a long history of conflicts. Chris Brown, who allegedly fought Drake in a bar, has publicly defended Meek Mill over legal issues. Meek Mill and Drake had been beefing since 2015, when Meek alleged that Drake didn’t write his own bars:

						Drake may be referring to his late OVO affiliate, Fif, who was gunned down in Toronto in September 2017. Drake later commemorated him with a tattoo of his face on his forearm a few days after his passing.

						This may also refer to frequent collaborator, Lil Wayne, whom Drake considers a big brother. He has had a frequent history of almost deadly seizures heightened by his use of the narcotic, lean.

						Drake frequently calls himself “6 God” in his music; “the 6” is a nickname for Toronto (and its six boroughs), where Drake is from, so calling himself “6 God” is his way of expressing his influence on the Toronto scene.
						
						<p>However, this isn’t the first time Drake’s given it up to a religious God rather than himself. On the If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late cut “Jungle,” he raps:</p>
						<blockquote>
							"These days, I’m lettin' God handle all things above me"
						</blockquote>
						<p>And on “Sneakin’,” his 2016 collaboration with 21 Savage, he raps an even more closely.</p>

						Drake seems fixated on the idea that death will immortalize him. He mentioned the same idea in the first verse of this song, but it’s clearly been on his mind for a while—he memorably rapped about it on 2015’s “Legend”: “If I die, I’m a legend”

						Drake has a very close relationship with his mom, Sandi Graham. In the past, he’s referred to himself as a “momma’s boy.” Drake frequently mentions his mom in his songs, he even dedicated a song to her, titled “You & The 6.”
						<p>Drake referenced this line in an Instagram post dedicated to his mom on her 58th birthday, as well as in an image he posted two days following the release of “God’s Plan.”</p>

						Noah “40” Shebib is Toronto native, OVO family member, and Drake’s main musical partner as a producer and engineer. 40’s production has become synonymous with a changing trend in hip-hop.

						<p>Oliver North is the nickname for Oliver El-Khatib, Drake’s manager, half of October Firm, and OVO co-founder.</p>

						Without them, he wouldn’t be the artist he is today. But, with his friends Drake made an OVO Institution, or a “firm” as Drake preferred to call it during the More Life era.
